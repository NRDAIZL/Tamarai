Tamarai is a product-based marketplace where users can choose between the traditional online shopping experience or becoming a part of the seller community (maybe both).
Tamarai is an easy access to both users and sellers as it provides connection and flexibility with the shopping experience.
A user can create an account on Tamarai to gain full access to the market and seller gallery, or create an account as a seller to showcase their products and lure potential buyers.
NEW FEATURE:Users can communicate with admins of the market about any difficulties or general inquiries through a chat.
Our team (consisting of shahd, menna, nermein, asmaa, nadine) aim to keep and maintain the web application in a user-friendly state from the littlest details to the big picture.
